scripts using Moneydance's python interface to update transactions
in Moneydance

import_account_trax.py 

This is a first attempt to parse csv file downloaded
from AccountTrax accounts (401k plans that use Vanguard mutual funds).
Securities (looked up by ticker symbol) must exist in the referenced
account, or the transactions will not be created.

Other Notes:
- Treats a Gain/Loss "Buy" or "Sell" transaction as two separate 
Moneydance parent transactions, one to record the security shares
bought or sold due to the gain or loss, and a "MiscInc" or "MiscExp"
transaction to change the account balance accordingly.
- Distinguishes other "Buy" transactions by the comment "contribution",
which means that the securities are bought with outside contributions
rather than from the balance of the account.  These are entered 
as "BuyXfr" transactions in Moneydance.
- Gained a lot of information from Moneydance by looking at the
Java docs and by selecting a hand-entered transaction and clicking
"Show Transaction Details" to see an XML representation of the
transaction.  Note that "<PARENTAMT>" values shown
in the transaction details are shown as negative values, relative
to the "parentAmount" argument passed to the SplitTxn constructor.
As the comment for the constructor indicates, the constructor "Creates a 
SplitTxn with the parentAmount having a negative effect on the 
account of parentTxn".  A bit confusing, but I guess it's logical.
Also had to figure out that there is an "Auto" built-in security account
that has to be used when specifying the account side of the split.
- Note that in this system, a positive balance means you are adding
to your portfolio (which actually costs money).
- TODO: Handle "TAKEOVER" AccountTrax actions.  These are used when
rolling over securities into an AccountTrax account, to balance the
AccountTrax shares purchased instead.
- TODO: If re-importing a file, find and skip over matching transactions.
- TODO: Dump skipped transactions or other errors to a log file.

import_morgan_stanley.py 

First attempt to do the same for MorganStanley ClientServ downloads.
Not fully tested.  

- TODO: The positive and negative signs are reversed in
MorganStanley's files from those in AccountTrax.  Will resolve and
try to standardize.
- TODO: Need a way to assign and lookup government bonds (no ticker symbol)
